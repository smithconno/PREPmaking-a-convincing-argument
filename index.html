<h1> Making a Convincing Argument </h1>
<p>
  My cause is family. They are the driving force behind what I do on a daily basis. A misconception about family being a cause that drives me would be maybe that I should not care about what they think of me and I should just worry about myself. My argument against that misconception would be very clear and concise, very quick to the point. Core facts would be the emphasis of my argument, and only key facts because if myths were added to my argument I would be at risk of an Overkill Backfire Effect. One thing that I would need to have is a visualization of known facts to back my argument. A visualization in this sense is a model that serves as a conduit between a mental model in the designer's brain and a mental model inside the audience's brain. This would help the audience develop a sense of what point you are trying to get across, especially if the audience is made up of visual learners. Using myths will also prove to the audience that they are wrong about their misconception, and being proven they are wrong will hurt them as much as physical pain.
